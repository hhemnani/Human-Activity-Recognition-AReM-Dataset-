ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores time series classification for human activity recognition using the AReM dataset. The dataset was collected using a Wireless Sensor Network, where each instance represents sensor recordings of a human performing one of seven activities.

We perform feature extraction (time-domain statistics) and use those features for:

Binary classification: Detecting bending vs. other activities.

Multiclass classification: Predicting all 7 activity classes.

Both classical logistic regression (with variable selection and L1 regularization) and NaÃ¯ve Bayes are tested.
